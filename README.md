# kendryte-toolchain-arm
Temporary repository for unofficial armhf and aarch64 builds of the SeeedStudio Kendryte toolchains.

This repository is public but is being used by me to try to get an unofficial repository for armhf and aarch64 Arduino working for the Grove AI HAT.
The .json seems to need an online repository so here it is.

The archives are of the standalone build but seem to work for Arduino.

Please consider the state of this repository to be non-working unless stated otherwise.

The toolchains were built unmodified from https://github.com/kendryte/kendryte-gnu-toolchain
